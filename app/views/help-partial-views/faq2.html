            <span class="style6"><strong>Important</strong> This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how   to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the   registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps   carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it.   Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs.

          <div >You may have to increase the default time-out value for persistent HTTP   connections in Internet Explorer if you are using a Web program that must   communicate with Internet Explorer over the same TCP/IP socket after one idle   minute. To change the default time-out value for persistent HTTP connections in   Internet Explorer, add a DWORD value that is named KeepAliveTimeout to the   following registry key, and then set its value data to the time (in   milliseconds) that you want Internet Explorer to wait before resetting an idle   connection:
          </div>
          <DIV>
            <div >HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\InternetSettings</div>
          </DIV>
          <div >To   do this, follow these steps:
            <OL>
              <LI>Click <STRONG>Start</STRONG>, click <STRONG>Run</STRONG>, type regedit, and then   click <STRONG>OK</STRONG>.   
              <LI>Locate and then click the following key in the registry:
              </OL>
          </div>
          <OL><LI><DIV>
            <div >HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\InternetSettings</div>
          </DIV>
              <LI>
                <div >On the <STRONG>Edit</STRONG> menu, point to <STRONG>New</STRONG>, and then click <STRONG>DWORD   Value</STRONG>.  
                </div>
              <LI>
                <div>Type KeepAliveTimeout, and then press ENTER.   
                </div>
              <LI>
                <div >On the <STRONG>Edit</STRONG> menu, click <STRONG>Modify</STRONG>.   
                </div>
              <LI>
                <div >Type the appropriate time-out value (in milliseconds), and then click <STRONG>OK</STRONG>. For example, to set the time-out value to two   minutes, type 120000.  
                </div>
              <LI>
                <div >Restart Internet Explorer.</div>
              </LI>
          </OL>
          <div >If you set the KeepAliveTimeout value to   less than 60,000 (one minute), you may have problems communicating with Web   servers that require persistent HTTP connections. For example, you may receive a   "Page cannot be displayed" error message. <BR>
              <BR>
            If you must have a   KeepAliveTimeout value higher than 120000 (two minutes), you must create an   additional registry key and set its value equal to the KeepAliveTimeout value   that you want. The additional registry key is ServerInfoTimeout. It is a DWORD   with a value (in milliseconds) and in the same location as   KeepAliveTimeout.<BR>
            <BR>
            For example, to use a three-minute KeepAliveTimeout   value, you must create the following registry keys:
          </div>
          <DIV>
            <div>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\InternetSettings<BR>
              <BR>
                <strong>KeepAliveTimeout</strong> DWORD value 180000 (in milliseconds) <BR>
                <strong>ServerInfoTimeout</strong> DWORD value   180000 (in milliseconds)<br>
              </div>
          </DIV>
          <div>By default, HTTP 1.1 is enabled in Internet   Explorer except when you establish an HTTP connection through a proxy server.   When HTTP 1.1 is enabled, HTTP connections remain open (or persistent) by   default until the connection is idle for one minute or until the value that is   specified by the KeepAliveTimeout value in the registry is reached. You can   modify HTTP 1.1 settings in Internet Explorer by using the <STRONG>Advanced</STRONG> tab in the <STRONG>Internet   Options</STRONG> dialog box.</div>
